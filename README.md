## Fast Food Website
## 3/10/2021
## Description
The objective was to replicate a template of a fast food website which we were provided.
## Set-up and Insstallation
Sadly no media queries were used in this replication so to view the page at optimal performance after cloning the repository I would recommend viewing it on full screen.
## Technology Used
I used Visual Studio to code the entire project and used my chrome browser to be able to view what i had already done and also help me understand what i needed to change.
